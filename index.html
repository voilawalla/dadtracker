				It's 2017. Dad could be anywhere. Wanderlust struck at 13, when he and his brother Keith left his mother and the other seven kids with their drunk stepdad. The boys headed for Texas, got in a few fights and landed in jail. Three years and a couple of lies later, Carroll Conrad Walla was a U.S. Marine and got to "volunteer" for some desert atomic action in Nevada. He has handed out Bibles on the dirt roads of Curacao and brought a surprise bride home from Hong Kong. In between salmon fishing trips to the Artic Circle, he recently found time to adopt a boy in the Philippines. So, he has a pacemaker and a 4-year-old boy. Oh -- and it's his second pacemaker.

        <h3>Places We've Lived</h3>
        <p>
          Us six kids moved every year or so, milk cows and all. Here are some of my favorite joints:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#glacier">Roadside camp, Going-to-the-Sun Highway</a></li>
          <li><a href="#bitterroot">When he taught school in Stevensville</a></li>
          <li><a href="#Nye">Those summers by the Yogo sapphire mine</a></li>

        <h3>Pack Accordingly</h3>
        <p>
          Dad has a lot of considered thoughts about the last 78 years:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Don't buy anything you can't carry</li>
          <li>Just wing it -- you will shock your daughter by not following any of her directions to get to her wedding in France and you will still run across her in a random train station in Beziers the day before.</li>
          <li>If you don't like a job, just quit</li>
          <li>No suitcases make it past the Pearly Gates</li>
        </ol>
